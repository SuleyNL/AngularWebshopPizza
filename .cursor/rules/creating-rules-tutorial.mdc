    # IMPORTANT RULE: HOW TO CREATE CURSOR RULES

    This tutorial explains the exact step-by-step process for creating Cursor rules:

    ## Step 1: Create an Empty File First
    
    **ALWAYS create an empty file first!** This is crucial for proper file registration.
    
    ```
    1. Identify the .cursor/rules/ directory in the project
    2. Create an empty file with your rule name using the .mdc extension:
       .cursor/rules/your-rule-name.mdc
    ```
    
    ## Step 2: Open the Empty File
    
    After creating the empty file, you should open it to see if the IDE has auto-generated 
    the skeleton frontmatter:
    
    ```
    ---
    description: 
    globs: 
    alwaysApply: false
    ---
    ```
    
    ## Step 3: Fill in the Frontmatter
    
    Complete the frontmatter section with:
    
    ```
    ---
    description: Description of the task this rule is helpful for
    globs: "**/*.js", "**/*.ts" # File patterns this rule applies to, leave empty if not applied
    alwaysApply: true or false    # Whether rule should always apply
    ---
    ```
    
    ## Step 4: Add Your Rule Content
    
    Below the frontmatter, add your rule content in this structure:
    
    ```
    name: Your Rule Name
    version: "1.0"
    rule_definition:
      description: "Detailed description of your rule"
      instructions: |
        # RULE TITLE

    ```
    
    ## Real Example
    
    Here's how I created the "Document All Code" rule:
    
    1. Created empty file: `.cursor/rules/document-all-code.mdc`
    2. Opened the file to check for auto-generated content
    3. Added the frontmatter:
       ```
       ---
       description: Ensure all code is properly documented
       globs: "**/*.js", "**/*.ts", "**/*.jsx", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.py", "**/*.cs", "**/*.java", "**/*.c", "**/*.cpp", "**/*.h", "**/*.hpp"
       alwaysApply: true
       ---
       ```
    4. Added the rule content with documentation guidelines
    
    Remember: Creating an empty file first is essential for proper rule registration in Cursor!
