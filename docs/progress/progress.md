## Development Notes

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Angular Setup**: Initial setup of the Angular application required careful configuration to ensure proper routing and component structure.
2. **Spring Boot Configuration**: Setting up the Spring Boot application with the right dependencies and configuration took some time to get right.
3. **Responsive Design**: Implementing responsive design from the start is easier than retrofitting it later. Using CSS Grid and Flexbox makes responsive layouts more straightforward.

### Lessons Learned
1. **Modular Architecture**: Breaking down the application into smaller, focused components makes development and maintenance easier.
2. **API Design**: Designing a clean API with proper DTOs helps maintain separation between the frontend and backend.
3. **Testing Approach**: Implementing sample data loaders makes testing easier during development.

## Testing Status
- Basic application structure has been implemented and can be tested.
- The responsive design works well on different device sizes.
- Header and footer components provide a consistent navigation experience.
- The homepage showcases the Italian pizza shop theme with a hero section and featured pizzas.
